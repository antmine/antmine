# Antmine

## What this repository about ?
Antine is the EIP ([Epitech](https://epitech.eu) Innotiative Project or end-of-study project) of 7 computer science students. This idea was to prove that advertising was not the only way to make a website profitable. This repository is just the big proof of concept using bictoin.

### The idea
When you navigate throw internet you doesn't use 100% of your computed capacity. What happend if you can used a small part of each web surfer's computing power ? Can we used this distributed power to make money ? That is the purpose of the antmine projet.

All along the developpement, the team had 3 mandatory rules:
 - we don't want to make people, cash cows
 - we stand for a free internet  and want make the world a little bit better
 - the projet is proof of concept for a new alternative of website profitability

### In facts
The projet works but it's not perfect at all. We proved that mining crypto-currency throw a brower can be succefully done.  Our solution is not the best, it's even not a solution at all. If you use antmine is the current state, yoy will not make any benefice. The projet existed only as a concept not a reel implementation.

### What can we/you upgrade ?
Because of the school deadline, the projet is not completed finished. Here you will find some example of what we didn't do.
 - the bitcoin reatribution based on users participation is not working
 - the projet can manager many crypto-currencies but actully only bitcoin is implemented
 - improve desgin dashboard
 - make stastistque usefull
 - ...


## How it's works ?
For more technicals informations about the project, please read [this](https::/github.com/antmine/antmine). _The technical documentation will be released soon._


## And now ?
Now, your studies are completed and we leave this projet to the open source community. Do what you want with this project. Just think of writing us if you using it. It will be nice of you.
